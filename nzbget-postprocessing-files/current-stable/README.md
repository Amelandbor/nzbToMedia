Current stable release is NZBGet V11.0
NZBGet V11+ calls multiple scripts directly. This current configuration is no-longer used and the entire nzbget-postprocessing-files folder will be deleted once all nzbget packages are updated.
Please see http://nzbget.sourceforge.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=740 for details of the new scripts concept.
